# Cadence workflow graph 

I'm currently working on project at Uber to graphically represent a workflow history run in their open source project Cadence. Cadence, in its essence, is an 
orchestration engine to build scalable applications. 

During the project I compared different drawing libraries such as D3, Vis.js and Cytoscape. 

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
